In addition, intermediaries generally reduce socially unnecessary capital liquidation, again tending to promote growth.}

Financial intermediation promotes growth because it allows a higher rate of return to be earned on capital, and growth in turn provides the means to implement costly financial structures. Thus financial intermediation and economic growth are inextricably linked in accord with the Goldsmith-McKinnon-Shaw view on economic development. The model also generates a development cycle reminiscent of the Kuznet hypothesis. In particular, in the transition from a primitive slow-growing economy to a developed fast-growing one, a nation passes through a stage in which the distribution of wealth across the rich and poor widens.}

However, the term is rarely defined with adequate precision and some crucial ambiguities are explored in this article. Among these is the commonplace ambivalence over whether explanations should be in terms of individuals alone, or in terms of individuals plus relations between them. It is shown that a great deal hinges on this subtle and often overlooked distinction in explanantia. In particular, explanations in terms of individuals alone have never, as yet, been achieved. Furthermore, the more feasible version of explanations in terms of individuals plus relations between them amounts to the introduction of social structure alongside individuals in the explanantia. Serious questions remain whether this version warrants the one-sided emphasis on individuals in the term `methodological individualism'. JEL Classifications: B20, B40, B41},

However, few economists are able to give an accurate account of what distinguishes micro and macro. The increasing interest in the `microfoundations of macroeconomics' has typically attracted those who feel that economics is about the rational behaviour of individuals and who regard macro propositions as a consequence of the intentions of individuals. As a result, `microfoundations' have come to be synonymous with theories of individual behaviour.  However, Maarten Janssen argues that it is microeconomics' concern with the functioning of markets that underlies theories of microfoundations. This claim is substantiated by an analysis of the aggregation problem, of the foundations of equilibrium theories, of the rational expectations hypothesis, and of a model from the New Keynesian literature.},

Chapters fall into three general categories: received views in philosophy of economics, ongoing controversies in microeconomics, and issues in modeling, macroeconomics, and development. Specific topics include methodology, game theory, experimental economics, behavioral economics, neuroeconomics, computational economics, data mining, interpersonal comparisons of utility, measurement of welfare and well being, growth theory and development, and microfoundations of macroeconomics. The Oxford Handbook of Philosophy of Economics is a groundbreaking reference like no other in its field.

Methodological individualism is discussed as a project of reductionism, by reviewing reductionism in the context of social sciences, and by analysing methodological individualism in the context of neoclassical economics. Philosophical and institutionalist critiques are then employed to elucidate that methodological individualism as practised in neoclassical economics is not capable of explaining real world phenomena, especially that of the predominantly traditional societies of the developing countries. The rational choice theory as espoused in neoclassical economics is also discussed and an attempt is made to build an institutionalist critique from the perspectives of various strands of institutionalisms in economics. The new institutionlist economics, though some relaxation of the axioms has been attempted, still upholds the neoclassical maxims of methodological individualism and rational choice, thereby treating the institutional as external to the `rational' realm. The approach of the alternative institutionalist school which attempts to explain individual agency as influenced by the social as well as institutional contexts seems more suitable to explain real world phenomena.},

Financial institutions' use of financial technology (FinTech) has resulted in changes in the delivery of financial services, subsequently affecting economic growth. However, the pandemic disrupted the demand and supply of goods worldwide, which has had a detrimental impact on the economy. It is worth investigating whether the global economic slump created by the pandemic have a beneficial influence on the national economy because of the introduction of innovative technologies. Using 778 country-year observations from 193 countries between 2018 and 2021, this study examines and finds that the positive impact of FinTech on economic growth is more pronounced during the pandemic. Further analysis shows that this association holds only in countries with high Internet usage, suggesting that the incremental impact of FinTech on economic growth during the pandemic depends on the extent of local Internet usage. Overall, our findings suggest that FinTech plays an important role in reducing the severity of the pandemic's subsequent economic impact.},

Although the existing literature has confirmed that investment and foreign business are two central growth engines of African's economy, examinations on the impacts of financial development (FD)-economic growth (EG) nexus using a comprehensive structure are still unusual. This paper examines the dynamic nexus between financial development-Economic growths using a country data set covering the period 1980 to 2017 by using panel vector autoregressive and the panel quantile regression technique. The empirical results confirm that significant cointegration relationships among FD-EG exist, no matter in the sub-sample for the countries. At the same time the granger causality test, report that foreign direct investment (FDI) and trade granger cause per capita gross domestic product. The motivation of the empirical investigation lies in reviewing the broad effect of financial development-economic growth nexus and providing precise recommendations to policymakers. Also, to make the conclusion more relevant, we discussed the results for the subsamples for the developing African countries (Western, Southern, Northern, Central, and Eastern). Distinctive indicators for financial development are applied to affirm the stability and robustness of the estimation outcomes. Further restructuring the financial system and accelerating the change of the economic structure are dynamic for African's sustainable economic growth.},

She argues for an economics that uses a comprehensive understanding of human action beyond behaviorism. ~ McCloskey clearly articulates her points of contention with believers in ``imperfections,'' from Samuelson to Stiglitz, claiming that they have neglected scientific analysis in their haste to diagnose the ills of the system. In an engaging and erudite manner, she reaffirms the global successes of market-tested betterment and calls for empirical investigation that advances from material incentives to an awareness of the human within historical and ethical frameworks.

It captures this field of countless exciting interconnections, affinities, and opportunities for cross-fertilization.  Comprising~35 chapters by a diverse team of contributors from all over the globe, the Handbook is divided into eight sections:　 I. RationalityII. Cooperation and InteractionIII. MethodologyIV. ValuesV. Causality and ExplanationVI. Experimentation and SimulationVII. EvidenceVIII. Policy　 The volume is essential reading for students and researchers in economics and philosophy who are interested in exploring the interconnections between the two disciplines.

In a typical Marshallian short period, demand for a commodity (for example, fish1) has recently risen and is expected to remain at its new level. Output is limited for the time being by the existing capital equipment of the industry (trawlers). Competition prevails and the price of the commodity is equal to marginal costs to the firms concerned. Marginal costs are rising sharply as demand strains against the limits of capacity. Marginal cost, and therefore price, exceeds average cost, and profits (quasi-rents) stand at a level which causes the firms already in the industry to place orders for more capital equipment, and induces new firms to enter the market. This corresponds, when extended to output as a whole, to a situation where prospective profits are inducing a level of investment which keeps effective demand at a satisfactorily high level.},

While economic globalization can be a boon for countries that are trying to dig out of poverty, success usually requires following policies that are tailored to local economic and political realities rather than obeying the dictates of the international globalization establishment. A definitive statement of Rodrik's original and influential perspective on economic growth and globalization, One Economics, Many Recipes shows how successful countries craft their own unique strategies--and what other countries can learn from them.  To most proglobalizers, globalization is a source of economic salvation for developing nations, and to fully benefit from it nations must follow a universal set of rules designed by organizations such as the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the World Trade Organization and enforced by international investors and capital markets. But to most antiglobalizers, such global rules spell nothing but trouble, and the more poor nations shield themselves from them, the better off they are. Rodrik rejects the simplifications of both sides, showing that poor countries get rich not by copying what Washington technocrats preach or what others have done, but by overcoming their own highly specific constraints. And, far from conflicting with economic science, this is exactly what good economics teaches.},

We present a model of financial repression, inflationary finance and endogenous growth. The model suggests that governments might choose to repress the financial sector because this policy increases the demand for money and delivers easy inflationary revenues. We also show that policies of financial repression reduce the growth rate of the economy. Next, we present the empirical evidence on the relation between measures of financial repression and growth in a large cross-section of countries. The implications of the theory are confirmed in that, after controlling for other determinants of growth, various measures of financial repression affect growth negatively, inflation rates (and banks' reserve ratios) and growth are negatively related. We also find that, after controlling for policies of financial repression, a regional dummy for Latin America in growth regressions tends to be insignificant. This suggests that a fraction of the weak growth experience of the Latin American countries might be explained by the policies of financial repression followed by the governments in this region.},

Of those who argue against him, Schumpeter asks a fundamental question: "Is it really artificial to keep separate the phenomena incidental to running a firm and the phenomena incidental to creating a new one?" In his answers, Schumpeter offers guidance to Third World politicians no less than First World businesspeople. In his substantial new introduction, John E.

A wake-up call to economists who failed to foresee every recent crisis, including the cataclysm of 2008, The 10 Rules of Successful Nations is a slim primer full of pioneering insights on the political, economic, and social habits of successful nations. Distilled from Sharma's quarter century traveling the world as a writer and investor, his rules challenge conventional textbook thinking on what matters{\textemdash}and what doesn't{\textemdash}for a strong economy. He shows why successful nations embrace robots and immigrants, prefer democratic leaders to autocrats, elect charismatic reformers over technocrats, and pay no mind to the debate about big versus small government. He explains why rising stock prices matter as much or more than food prices, which measure of debt is the best predictor of economic crises, and why no one number can accurately capture the value of a currency. He also demonstrates how a close reading of the Forbes billionaire lists can offer the clearest real-time warning of populist revolts against the wealthy. Updated with brand-new data, 10 Rules reimagines economics as a practical art, giving general readers as well as political and business leaders a quick guide to the most important forces that shape a nation's future.},

What stands out, but is seldom noted, is that this occurred within democracies where the relative losers -- the overwhelming majority -- could in principle have used the political system to block or reverse rising inequality. Why did they not do so? A glance at history reveals that peoples have only very infrequently contested inequality because they were led to believe that their inferior status in terms of income, wealth, and privilege was just, that it was not really so bad, or that it was necessary for their future wellbeing. Ideological systems legitimated a status quo of inequality, or in more modern times even increasing inequality. This article surveys the manner in which inequality has been historically legitimated, first predominantly by religion, then predominately by economic thought. Attention is then focused on the manner in which contemporary economic science and its popular interpretations in the media have served to legitimate inequality in the U.S. since the mid-1970s. The paper concludes with a reflection on the unique conditions that enable the legitimation of inequality to be delegitimated.{$<$}br{$><$}small{$>$}(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.){$<$}/small{$>$}},

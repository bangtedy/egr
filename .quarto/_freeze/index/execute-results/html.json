Specific theoretical models drive a particular empirical analysis: the theoretical models identify specific features and mechanisms of economies and trace their implications for growth over time.\n\n2. The empirical work is more loosely connected to any specific model and driven more by data and statistical forces: insights are â€œborn from the data\".\n\n## PLAN\n\n- Global panel data (ASEAN or ASIA countries)\n- Tools:\n  + Econometrics: parametric, nonparametric (track 1)\n  + Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) --> white box Machine Learning (track 2)\n\n## Data {.scrollable .smaller}\n\n- [World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org/en/home)\n- [IMF](https://www.imf.org/en/Home)\n- [UNCTAD](https://unctad.org/)\n- [Penn World Table](https://www.rug.nl/ggdc/productivity/pwt/?lang=en)\n- [PISA](https://www.oecd.org/pisa/)\n- [WIPO statistic](https://www.wipo.int/ipstats/en/)\n- [World Values Survey](https://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/wvs.jsp)\n- [World Inequality Report](https://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/wvs.jsp)\n- [UQICD](https://uqicd.economics.uq.edu.au/)\n- [Global Entrepreneurship and Development Institute](http://thegedi.org/global-entrepreneurship-and-development-index/)\n- R and Python\n\n## References\n\n\n\n\n```{=html}\n<!-- \n# {background-iframe=\"grid-worms/index.html\"} \nBackground for title slide, not working in this version of Quarto -->\n```\n",

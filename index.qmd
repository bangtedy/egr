## One century thought

- In 1912 (@schumpeterTheoryEconomicDevelopment1983) argued that the services provided by financial intermediaries are essential for technological innovation and economic development.

## Close ties

- Early empirical work by (@goldsmithFinancialStructureDevelopment1969; @mckinnonMoneyCapitalEconomic1970) illustrates the close ties between financial and economic development for a few countries.

## Strong and robust

- @kingFinanceGrowthSchumpeter1993: indicators of the level of financial development are strongly and robustly correlated with growth, the rate of physical capital accumulation, and improvements in the efficiency of capital allocation.

## Multilevel studies

- @levineFinancialDevelopmentEconomic1997: Firm-level studies, industry-level studies, individual country-studies, and broad cross country comparisons: a strong positive link between 
the functioning of the financial system and long-run economic growth.

## Contra

- @robinsonGeneralisationGeneralTheory1979: financial development simply follows economic growth..."where enterprise leads finance follows"
- @lucasMechanicsEconomicDevelopment1988: the relationship between financial and economic development "over-stressed." 

## A number of possibilities {.scrollable}

- The links between financial development and economic growth *vice versa* are open to a number of possibilities.
- No doubt, economic growth and financial system is shaped by financial and nonfinancial factors: technology(@mertonFinancialInnovationEconomic1992), legal systems (@laportaLawFinance1996), monetary and fiscal policies (@bencivengaFinancialIntermediationEndogenous1991; @roubiniFinancialRepressionEconomic1992), political changes and national institutions (@haberIndustrialConcentrationCapital1991), human capital.
- Economic growth alters the willingness of savers and investors to pay the costs associated with participating in the financial system (@greenwoodFinancialDevelopmentGrowth1990).

## Therefore {.scrollable}

- We need much more research on financial development! 
- Why does financial structure change as countries grow? 
- Why do countries at similar stages of economic development have different looking financial systems? 
- Are there long-run economic growth advantages to adopting legal and policy changes that create one type of financial structure vis-a-vis another? 
- Much more information about the determinants and implications of financial structure will move us closer to a comprehensive view of financial development and economic growth. 

## Institutions

- Incentive (@easterlyElusiveQuestGrowth2002)
- Property right (@fernandezmartinInstitutionsFinancialDevelopment2015; @cheangInstitutionsEconomicDevelopment2023)
- Power relations (@fernandezmartinInstitutionsFinancialDevelopment2015; @ozanneWhyPowerMatters2016; @bartlettEconomicsPowerInquiry1989)

## Two Tracks: Theory-Driven vs Data-Driven {.scrollable}

1. Specific theoretical models drive a particular empirical analysis: the theoretical models identify specific features and mechanisms of economies and trace their implications for growth over time.

2. The empirical work is more loosely connected to any specific model and driven more by data and statistical forces: insights are “born from the data".

## PLAN

- Global panel data (ASEAN or ASIA countries)
- Tools:
  + Econometrics: parametric, nonparametric (track 1)
  + Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) --> white box Machine Learning (track 2)
